## Introduction

In many scenarios, uploading large files to a server can be challenging due to limitations in file size or network conditions. This project provides a solution by allowing the client to split a large file into smaller chunks and upload them individually to the server. Once all chunks are received, the server combines them into a single file.

## Features

- Split large files into smaller chunks for easier uploading.
- Upload chunks to the server asynchronously.
- Combine uploaded chunks into a single file on the server.
- Accepts all types of files.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Installation

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isaka-james/chunks-to-file.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd chunks-to-file
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/`.
3. Select a file using the provided input field.
4. Click the "Upload" button to initiate the upload process.
5. The server will receive the file chunks and combine them into a single file inside the `uploads` folder.
